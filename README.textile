h1. Handcrafted Foundation

Handcrafted is a small team of Ruby on Rails developers (mainly "Josh Owens":http://josh.the-owens.com and "Adam Stacoviak":http://adamstacoviak.com/). We focus on creating smart, usable web sites built on a foundation of clean, extensible, handcrafted code. We eat our own dog food, we use Foundation as our core starting point to ensure consistency through-out our applications. We bake all our goodness in here. Once.

Foundation is built with certain specific standards and opinions in mind. We were tired of re-writing and copy & pasting the same code over and over from project to project. Then git came along. Git helped us realize there was a better way.

h2. Key Concepts

* Make the app extensible by offering smart hooks for engines and plugins to add functionality
* Keep the code clean. Break repeating code out into partials and re-use as needed
* Write semantic HTML/Haml. Of course clean, organized CSS/Sass goes with that. And with the help of Compass, we get to ensure that we keep our CSS/Sass DRY
* Tests, tests, tests. If you aren't testing. You are wrong.

h2. Opinionated Choices

* "Haml":http://haml-lang.com/, "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/, "Compass":http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass
* "JQuery":http://jquery.com/
* "JQuery Tools":http://flowplayer.org/tools/
* "qTip":http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/
* Delayed Job
* AuthLogic
* NewRelic
* Hoptoad

h2. Gotchas

* We try to use "Markers" in key files, such as routes and application.js. We do this to ensure that continued foundation development doesn't trample continued application development
* Don't annotate the base Foundation application. You should only be annotating the models in your real application
